.\" cligPart OPTIONS
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -gpu
A list of CUDA device ID's, specifying the GPU's to use. If no items are specified all GPU's will be used. Device id's can be found with: accelseach -lsgpu,
.br
0...32 Int values between 0 and 32.
.IP -nbatch
A list of the number of batches of f-∂f planes to process on each CUDA device, Each batch is run in its own thread and allows concurrency. Listed in the same order as -gpu. If only one value is specified it will be used for all GPUs,
.br
0...32 Int values between 1 and 5.
.br
Default: `2'
.IP -nsteps
A list of the number of f-∂f planes each batch on each CUDA device is to process. Listed in the same order as -gpu. If only one value is specified it will be used for all batches,
.br
0...32 Int values between 1 and 8.
.br
Default: `4'
.IP -numopt
A list of the number of canidates to process on each CUDA device, Each canidate is run in its own thread and allows concurrency. Listed in the same order as -gpu. If only one value is specified it will be used for all GPUs,
.br
0...32 Int values between 1 and 7.
.br
Default: `4'
.IP -width
The width of the larges f-∂f plane. Values should be one of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 and represent the width in 1000's of the closes power of two.,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 65536.
.br
Default: `4'
.IP -lsgpu
List all available CUDA GPU's and exit.
.IP -cpu
Do a CPU search.
.IP -ncpus
Number of processors to use with OpenMP,
.br
1 Int value between 1 and oo.
.br
Default: `1'
.IP -lobin
The first Fourier frequency in the data file,
.br
1 Int value between 0 and oo.
.br
Default: `0'
.IP -numharm
The number of harmonics to sum (power-of-two),
.br
1 Int value between 1 and 16.
.br
Default: `8'
.IP -zmax
The max (+ and -) Fourier freq deriv to search,
.br
1 Int value between 0 and 1200.
.br
Default: `200'
.IP -sigma
Cutoff sigma for choosing candidates,
.br
1 Float value between 1.0 and 30.0.
.br
Default: `2.0'
.IP -rlo
The lowest Fourier frequency (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -rhi
The highest Fourier frequency (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.IP -flo
The lowest frequency (Hz) (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.br
Default: `1.0'
.IP -fhi
The highest frequency (Hz) (of the highest harmonic!) to search,
.br
1 Double value between 0.0 and oo.
.br
Default: `10000.0'
.IP -inmem
Compute full f-fdot plane in memory.  Very fast, but only for short time series..
.IP -photon
Data is poissonian so use freq 0 as power normalization.
.IP -median
Use block-median power normalization (default).
.IP -locpow
Use double-tophat local-power normalization (not usually recommended).
.IP -zaplist
A file of freqs+widths to zap from the FFT (only if the input file is a *.[s]dat file),
.br
1 String value
.IP -baryv
The radial velocity component (v/c) towards the target during the obs,
.br
1 Double value between -0.1 and 0.1.
.br
Default: `0.0'
.IP -otheropt
Use the alternative optimization (for testing/debugging).
.IP -noharmpolish
Do not use 'harmpolish' by default.
.IP -noharmremove
Do not remove harmonically related candidates (never removed for numharm = 1).
.IP infile
Input file name of the floating point .fft or .[s]dat file.  A '.inf' file of the same name must also exist.

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
